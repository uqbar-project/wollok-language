# Changelog
The objective of this file is to document the changes to the Wollok language definition.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
Currently, the Wollok language does not adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). 
Hopefully, we will be able to do that in the near future.
