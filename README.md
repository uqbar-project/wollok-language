# Wollok Language

![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/uqbar-project/wollok-language) ![GitHub License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/uqbar-project/wollok-language)

This is the repository for the **Wollok Language definition**, and also the main access point for all resources.

## ‚ùì What is Wollok?

Wollok is a language designed to satisfy our main goals for teaching OO concepts. You can see [Wollok site](https://www.wollok.org) for further information.

## üìã About this repository

It is a Wollok Project which contains

- Wollok core libraries: strings, numbers, dates, booleans, etc. in `src` folder
- Wollok language specification, in form of unit tests: in `test` folder you'll see our **sanity tests** where you can check how should you use Wollok objects from core libraries, and syntax definitions.

All files follow a **standard coding convention**, please refer to them in the [developers section](https://github.com/uqbar-project/wollok-language/wiki/Development-Environment).

## üÜï Changes

- If you want to propose a change, please [open a new issue](/issues/new). Ideally, a new feature proposal should have: a) what do you want to achieve, b) why do you want the new feature, c) (optional) if it could solved with Wollok-side implementation or it could require native implementations, d) (optional, nice-to-have) acceptance tests. We have a sort of _consensus_ instead of a bureaucratic committee, and will evaluate and prioritize the proposal. Pending task: [add a template](https://help.github.com/es/github/building-a-strong-community/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository)
- Once approved, we should add it to the [changelog file](CHANGELOG.md), which could also be useful in case you need to migrate your examples according to different versions.
